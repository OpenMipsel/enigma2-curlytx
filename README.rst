Usage
=====

First run
=========
After installing CurlyTx and restarting Enigma2, open the main menu.
The first entry will be "CurlyTx" - activate it.

You will see the main window with the message
"Go and add a page in the settings".
Do just that end press the red button to access the settings window.

Now we'll add the first URL:

- Press the yellow button ("New"); the "page edit" window will show up
- Enter the page URL, e.g. http://ip.cweiske.de
- If you wish, enter a page title, e.g. "My IP"
- Set the text size if you want. 20 is a good default value.
- Press the green button ("OK"), and you are back on the settings window.
- The page you have just created is in the configuration list now.


If you made a mistake and want to change it, select the page with the
up/down buttons and press "OK" - the page edit window will open.

Press the green button and the settings will be saved.
You're back on the main window now and the URL you just configured will be loaded.

Note that with version 1.1, CurlyTx supports opening local files.
Prepend them with ``file://``, e.g. ``file:///tmp/test.txt``.


Adding many pages
=================
You can use the settings window to add new pages, but this gets tedious if you
want to add many pages.

It's better to use the Atom feed import in this case.
All you need is a text editor and a web server you can serve the feed page with.

Here is an example feed::

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
   <title>URL list for CurlyTx</title>
   <author>
    <name>Christian Weiske</name>
    <email>cweiske@cweiske.de</email>
   </author>
   <link rel="self" href="http://home.cweiske.de/pagefeed.atom"/>
   <entry>
    <id>ip</id>
    <title>My IP</title>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://ip.cweiske.de/" />
   </entry>
   <entry>
    <id>temp</id>
    <title>House temperatures</title>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://home/temperatures.txt" />
   </entry>
  </feed>

Start CurlyTx, go to the settings and write the feed URL in the
"Page feed URL" field.
Then press "OK" and the feed's pages will be loaded into the settings window.


Local configuration file
========================
CurlyTx looks for a local page feed file on the harddisk on every run,
at ``/etc/enigma2/curlytx-pagefeed.xml``.
If this file exists, it gets loaded unconditionally and overwrites
the current page configuration.

Modifying CurlyTx
=================


Translation
===========
Beginning a new translation
---------------------------
Replace ``$lang_code`` with your two-letter language code::

    $ cd po
    $ cp messages.po $lang_code.po
    ... edit $lang_code.po now
    $ ./compile.sh


Editing an existing translation
-------------------------------
Simply run ::

    $ cd po
    $ ./update.sh

This will update the translation template ``messages.pot`` from the source code
and will merge the changes into the single translation files.


Testing a translation
---------------------
Link your compiled translation file into ::

    src/locale/$lang_code/LC_MESSAGES/CurlyTx.mo

Enigma2 will pick it up automatically.


Building
========
First upgrade the version number in ``CONTROL/control``.

Then simply run ::

    ./build.sh

Directory ``releases/`` will contain the freshly baked ``.ipk`` file that can
then be transferred to your dreambox, e.g. via ``scp``::

    $ scp releases/enigma2-plugin-extensions-curlytx_2.3_mipsel.ipk dreambox:
    $ ssh dreambox
    $ ipkg install enigma2-plugin-extensions-curlytx_2.3_mipsel.ipk

You will need the ``ipkg-build`` script from
 http://reichholf.net/files/dreambox/tools/ipkg-build
